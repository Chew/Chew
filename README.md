# Creations

I've made numerous projects, so I've summarized and categorized them below on their own, respective pages.

## [Discord Bots](https://github.com/Chew/Chew/blob/master/projects/discord-bots.md)

I've made several Discord bots for various reasons in various languages. Some are server specific but some are global for all to use and enjoy!

## [Spigot Plugins](https://github.com/Chew/Chew/blob/master/projects/spigot-plugins.md)

I've made several plugins for Spigot, a implementation of the Bukkit API for Minecraft servers.
They are designed for [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC), which I highly recommend instead.

## [Memerator](https://github.com/Chew/Chew/blob/master/projects/memerator.md)

Memerator is my largest and most worked on project by far. I've described most of it in the link above, however.

# Development

I work to help out several projects, mostly in the Minecraft community.

## Triage

I am a triage team member for several organizations. 
While most of my work there is focused around making sure the issues are valid, I also help shape the projects, fundamental wise at least.

- [EssentialsX](https://github.com/EssentialsX)
- [mcMMO](https://github.com/mcMMO)

Hey! Thanks for checking me out. I make many projects, mostly for fun since I'm currently not in an computer science field at the moment, I do plan on going to college and getting some knowledge where needed.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I work on many projects! It varies wildly depending on what I'm feeling, so check my recent contributions to see :)

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

I'm learning more Ruby and Java, my first 2 languages. Every time I learn something new I always find out there's so much more I don't know. I do plan on learning more languages!

Everything! If you want to improve my (honestly, awful) projects, feel free to shoot me a PR!

## Stats and Graphs

I've caved and added some [readme stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats). They are pretty cool, so I hope it's not too annoying.
Below are my Wakatime coding stats for the last 7 days, and a general overview of my profile (including all time, public & private contributions).
