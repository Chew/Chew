### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Chew. My actual human name is Olivia though, you can call me whatever you want :p

I make many projects, mostly for fun since I'm currently not in an computer science field at the moment, I do plan on going to college and getting some knowledge where needed.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I work on many projects, it varies wildly depending on what I'm feeling, so check my recent commits to see :)

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

I'm learning more Ruby and Java, my first 2 languages. Every time I learn something new I always find out there's so much more I don't know. I do plan on learning more languages!

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on

Everything! If you want to improve my (honestly, awful) projects, feel free to shoot me a PR!

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with

There's some stuff I'm stuck on, but I always like a challenge :). 

## ðŸ˜„ Pronouns:

I have a cat named Rory! So as a result my free time to contribute is now much lower, gotta make sure she knows she's loved!
