# Creations

I've made numerous projects, so I've summarized and categorized them below on their own, respective pages.

## [Discord Bots](https://github.com/Chew/Chew/blob/master/projects/discord-bots.md)

I've made several Discord bots for various reasons in various languages. Some are server specific but some are global for all to use and enjoy!

## [Spigot Plugins](https://github.com/Chew/Chew/blob/master/projects/spigot-plugins.md)

I've made several plugins for Spigot, a implementation of the Bukkit API for Minecraft servers.
They are designed for [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC), which I highly recommend instead.

## [Memerator](https://github.com/Chew/Chew/blob/master/projects/memerator.md)

Memerator is my largest and most worked on project by far. I've described most of it in the link above, however.

# Development

I work to help out several projects, mostly in the Minecraft community.

## Triage

I am a triage team member for several organizations. 
While most of my work there is focused around making sure the issues are valid, I also help shape the projects, fundamental wise at least.

- [PaperMC](https://github.com/PaperMC)
- [GeyserMC](https://github.com/GeyserMC)
- [EssentialsX](https://github.com/EssentialsX)
