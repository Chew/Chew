# All my repositories

Here I describe every single one of my public repositories, in order of how much I like them, or so.

The descriptions may include how I made it, what my intentions were, what I plan to do (if it's active).

## TRBMB and Co.

The TRBMB (That really blanks my blank) Generators and "forks" of it made a significant impact on my early days on GitHub, and definitely was a lot of fun. Below are all projects related to it.

### [TRBMB-Gen](https://github.com/Chew/TRBMB-Gen)

*Language: HTML/JS<br>
Status: Dormant*

Inspired by Jacksfilms's "That really Blanks my Blank" YIAYs, I made this with a couple of my friends, we came up with over 120 possible phrases, so I wrote this up to randomize it. It spiraled off into many other things that all went nowhere. While this project was simple, it was a lot of fun, especially with the initial group I made it with. Outside of that group, it didn't quite make sense and didn't hit as hard, so it quickly died off when we went our own ways.

### [AcronymGenerator](https://github.com/Chew/AcronymGenerator)

*Language: HTML/JS<br>
Status: Dormant*

Not entirely sure what my motivation for this project was. I used a lot of the code from [TRBMB-Gen](https://github.com/Chew/Chew/new/master/projects/all-repos.md#trbmb-gen). The list of words to fill the acronyms was (and still is) filled in with words from Mineplex's Draw My Thing, resulting in acronyms that don't really make sense.

### [TRBMB-Extension](https://github.com/Chew/TRBMB-Extension)

*Language: HTML/JS<br>
Status: Dormant*

Simply TRBMB-Gen but as a Chrome extension. Not much going on here. Still works surprisingly. 

### [RussianReversalGenerator](https://github.com/Chew/RussianReversalGenerator)

*Language: HTML/JS<br>
Status: Inactive*

This came to be much like the TRBMB-Gen, with the same group of friends, in a much similar way. The concept was simple: "In Soviet Russia, blank blanks you!" but with random things. This one defintiely didn't get as much attention as the TRBMB-Gen, but is still a fun project too. Makes me reminiscent of the times where I actually had friends.

### [WotInBlankationGenerator](https://github.com/Chew/WotInBlankationGenerator)

*Language: HTML/JS<br>
Status: Inactive*

Definitely the weaker of the 3 generators I've made, this simply "What in blankation", such as "What in constellation," inspired by a meme that was active at the time. There isn't a large pool of phrases so it didn't get very far.

### [GeneratorGenerator](https://github.com/Chew/GeneratorGenerator)

*Language: HTML/JS<br>
Status: Inactive*

This was simply a generator to end all generators. It was TRBMB, RussianReversal, and WotInBlankation generators all on one site. Why? No clue. Don't ask me!

### [YMCA-Gen]((https://github.com/Chew/YMCA-Gen)

*Language: HTML/JS<br>
Status: Inactive*

This was simply a generator, much like the ones above, but specifically to fill in the "MC" in "YourMCAdmin," made as a joke, died as one.

## RubyGems

I've made several [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/profiles/Chew) in the past. They're all pretty cool, I'd say. Obviously the language to all of these are "Ruby"

### [DBLRuby](https://github.com/Chew/DBLRuby)

*Status: Dormant*

Starting off with DBLRuby, an API wrapper gem for the [top.gg](https://top.gg) (at the time, discordbots.org, hence DBL) API. It is of course the most popular gem I've made, but I try to keep it up to date. I recently revisited it and made it much better, after spending time in Java. The use case is specific but if you meet it, you should check it out.

### [ListcordRB](https://github.com/Chew/ListcordRB)

*Status: Archived*

Much like DBLRuby, this is an API Wrapper for the Listcord Discord Bot list. The service shut down many years ago with hints of coming back, though no progress has been made for a proper return. If the site and the API come back, so will this gem.

### [vivaldiupdater-ubuntu](https://github.com/Chew/vivaldiupdater-ubuntu)

*Status: Dormant*

I made this gem to help with installing and updating [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) on Ubuntu. As I haven't used Ubuntu in a while, I'm honestly not sure if it still works.

### [ShiftNoteRB](https://github.com/Chew/ShiftNoteRB)

*Status: Archived*

This gem died as quick as it came. It was for the scheduling software we had at work, to simplify things as these gems are supposed to do, however we've since switched off and so has my motivation to do anything with this.

### [dbiorb](https://github.com/Chew/dbiorb)

*Status: Active if needed*

This is a simple API Wrapper (see the pattern?) for the [discord.bio](https://discord.bio) API. Nothing overly interesting, but it works, hopefully.

### [HQTriviaRB](https://github.com/Chew/HQTriviaRB)

*Status: Dormant*

A simple API Wrapper for the HQ Trivia API. Didn't really get anywhere due to lack of interest/motivation around the time I was working on this.

### [MixerRB](https://github.com/Chew/MixerRB)

*Status: Archived*

This gem didn't make it very far. I spent maybe a day on it and that was the end of it. Mixer unfortunately died as well so this gem is forever dormant and archived. It was never published to RubyGems.

### [NumberSenseGenerator](https://github.com/Chew/NumberSenseGenerator)

*Status: Inactive*

This gem was actually a lot of fun to work on. The idea came from a friend asking for a program that could make Number Sense question/answer sheet to help them practice. Unfortunately, it had to be abandoned due to personal reasons. It got pretty far as well. Oh well. It was also never published.

### [ChewGem](https://github.com/Chew/ChewGem)

*Status: Inactive*

I'm not sure what the intention was behind this. I think it was supposed to be a bunch of smaller little nicknacks that don't really need their own gem, much like how my site is right now. I added one thing then completely abandoned it.

### [simple-delimiter](https://github.com/Chew/simple-delimiter)

*Status: Inactive*

This was originally supposed to be a fork of the Commatose gem, but was quickly abandoned when I didn't know what I was doing. It was released then promptly yanked from the Rubygems site. You can just use Rails's number_with_delimiter which I use instead.
