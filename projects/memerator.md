# Memerator

Memerator was a project started by my friend Brian and I. At the end of 10th grade we had an idea to have a way to upload memes and have people be able to rate it.
This idea has since expanded into something much larger, and I am very proud of it!

## Projects

Memerator consists of many projects, some of which private (regretfully).

### [Memerator.me](Memerator.me)

This is the main website. It was made using Ruby on Rails and it was started back in October of 2018. 
Brian helped a tiny bit but I ended up doing almost all of the work.

This was definitely a fun project that evolved many times over the years. Sadly development has slowed as it slowly shifted from a group project to a solo one.

### Memerator API

The API was split off from the main site and is also in Ruby on Rails.

### SDKs

I made some API libraries for the Memerator API in various languages as well.
