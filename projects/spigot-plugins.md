# Chew's Spigot Plugins

I've made quite a few Spigot / Paper plugins. Some are private and legally can be closed-source, the others are public and have to be open source since it needs to be GPLv3.

[JSONRestAPI](https://github.com/ChewMC/JSONRestAPI) - A plugin I've always wanted to make, it exposes a mini web server to listen to requests and parses them with PlaceholderAPI.

[CustomCommandPrefix](https://github.com/ChewMC/CustomCommandPrefix) - A simple plugin I made to allow a custom prefix for Geyser users.

[TransmuteIt](https://github.com/ChewMC/TransmuteIt) - A plugin that tries to mimic ProjectE transmutation logic.

[NoPlayersNoServer](https://github.com/ChewMC/NoPlayersNoServer) - Stops the server after a set period time if no one is on.

[ListenerNotifier](https://github.com/ChewMC/ListenerNotifier) - Listens for different events and notifies specific players that the event was raised.
